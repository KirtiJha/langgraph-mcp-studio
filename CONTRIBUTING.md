# Contributing to MCP Studio

We love your input! We want to make contributing to MCP Studio as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/KirtiJha/langgraph-mcp-studio/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/KirtiJha/langgraph-mcp-studio/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file with required environment variables
4. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code formatting (we use Prettier)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow React best practices and hooks guidelines

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Test on both macOS and Windows if possible

## Commit Messages

- Use clear and meaningful commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add more detail in the body if needed

Example:

```
Add tool execution visualization to chat interface

- Shows real-time tool execution status
- Displays tool arguments and results
- Implements collapsible tool details section
```

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please open an issue with:

- Clear description of the feature
- Use cases and benefits
- Any implementation ideas you might have

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue for questions or start a discussion in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/KirtiJha/langgraph-mcp-studio/discussions).
